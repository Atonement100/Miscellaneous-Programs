prog3_1 should be run as ./prog3_1 (-n|-c) (-L<N>) (-p) (-s) < in > out
All parameters are optional.
-n and -c are exclusive, the former will print only frequencies and the latter will replace dividing spaces with a comma
-L<N> can be used with an integer N to change the number of values that print per line
-p will print percents instead of frequencies
-s will sort the values in descending frequency/quantity before printing.
No known bugs.
